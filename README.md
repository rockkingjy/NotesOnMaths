####Set X, Subset
- Set: distinction between elements;

####Topology(X,T)
- "Topology": define what is a "open subset", which seperated from other subsets of set X;
- A set with this definition(distinction between subsets of set X) above is called "topological space";
- So we can define "continuous" on the mappings of different Topologies(open subsets).
- "Homeomorphism": 1.one-one-onto; 2."continuous"(C^0) forward and backward;
- Two Topologies "homeomorphic" to each other means, they are equal on the basis of "Topology";

####Manifold
- "n-dimensional differentiable manifold" M: 1.exist a "open cover" of M, such that, for every "open subset" of the "open cover", exist a homeomorphism to a "open subset" of R^n; 2.the mappings from any two different coordinate systems are "infinity differencial"(C^infinity);
- "Diffeomorphism": 1.one-one-onto; 2."infinity differential"(C^infinity) forward and backward;
- Two Manifolds "diffeomorphic" to each other means, they are equal on the basis of "Manifold";

####Group
- "Group": set G with a "product" GxG->G:associative, identity element, inverse element
- "Homomorphism": keep the "product" relationship;
- "Isomorphism": homomorphism + one-one-onto;
- Two Group "isomorphic" to each other means, they are equal on the basis of "Group";

####Lie Group
- "Lie group": Group + Manifold + c^infinity on "product" and "inverse" mappings;

####Algebra
- "Algebra":

####Lie Algebra
- "Lie algebra":
