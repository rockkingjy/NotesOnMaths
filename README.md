####Set X, Subset
- Set: distinction between elements;

####Topology(X,T)
- Topology: define what is a "open subset", which seperated from other subsets of set X;
- A set with this definition(distinction between subsets of set X) above is called "topological space";
- So we can define "continuous" on the mappings of different Topologies(open subsets).
- Homeomorphism: 1.one-one-onto; 2.continuous(C^0) forward and backward;
- Two Topology homeomorphic to each other means, they are equal on the basis of Topology;

####Manifold
