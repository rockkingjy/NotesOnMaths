####Set X, Subset
- Set: distinction between elements;

####Topology(X,T)
- "Topology": define what is a "open subset", which seperated from other subsets of set X;
- A set with this definition(distinction between subsets of set X) above is called "topological space";
- So we can define "continuous" on the mappings of different Topologies(open subsets).
- "Homeomorphism": 1.one-one-onto; 2."continuous"(C^0) forward and backward;
- Two Topologies "homeomorphic" to each other means, they are equal on the basis of "Topology";

####Manifold
- "n-dimensional differentiable manifold" M: 1.exist a "open cover" of M, such that, for every "open subset" of the "open cover", exist a homeomorphism to a "open subset" of R^n; 2.the mappings from any two different coordinate systems are "infinity differencial"(C^infinity);
- "Diffeomorphism": 1.one-one-onto; 2."infinity differential"(C^infinity) forward and backward;
- Two Manifolds "diffeomorphic" to each other means, they are equal on the basis of "Manifold";

####Group
- "Group": set G with a "product" GxG->G:associative, identity element, inverse element
- "Homomorphism": keep the "product" relationship;
- "Isomorphism": homomorphism + one-one-onto;
- Two Group "isomorphic" to each other means, they are equal on the basis of "Group";

####Lie Group
- "Lie group": Group + Manifold + C^infinity on "product" and "inverse" mappings;

####Algebra
- "Algebra":"Vector space" + "product";

####Lie Algebra
- "Lie algebra":"Vector space" + "Lie bracket"(a special "product");

####
- Scalar field on M(function on M): f:M->R;
- \mathfrak{F}_M: all the scalar fields on M;
- Vector: \mathfrak{F}_M->R;
- V_p: all the vectors on M of point p;
- X_\mu(f)=\partial f(x) / \partial x^\mu|_p = \partial F(x^1,...,x^n))/\partial x^\mu|_p, \forall f \in \mathfrak{F}_M. 
- {X_\mu(f)} are coordinate basis, v^\mu=v(x^\mu) are coordinate components of v;
