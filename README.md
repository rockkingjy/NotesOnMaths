####Set X, Subset
- Set: distinction between elements;

####Topology(X,T)
- Topology: define what is a "open subset", which seperated from other subsets of set X;
- A set with this definition(distinction between subsets of set X) above is called "topological space";
- So we can define "continuous" on the mappings of different Topologies(open subsets).
- Homeomorphism: 1.one-one-onto; 2."continuous"(C^0) forward and backward;
- Two Topologies homeomorphic to each other means, they are equal on the basis of Topology;

####Manifold
- n-dimensional differentiable manifold M: 

1.exist a "open cover" of M, such that, for every "open subset" of the "open cover", exist a homeomorphism to a "open subset" of R^n; 

2.the mappings from any two different coordinate systems are "infinity differencial"(C^infinity)

- Diffeomorphism: 1.one-one-onto; 2."infinity differencial"(C^infinity) forward and backward;
- Two Manifolds diffeomorphic to each other means, they are equal on the basis of Manifold;
